**🚀 Live Demo:** [Click here to view the deployed site](https://meiram707.github.io/ai-landing-page/)

A responsive landing page for the fictional AI platform NeuroSpark, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## 📌 Purpose

> This project was created to demonstrate my React front-end development skills by delivering a clean, maintainable, and responsive UI. It serves as a showcase of best practices in component design, theme handling, and asynchronous data integration.

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates clean React architecture, with well-separated, single-responsibility components. It includes theme switching, async fetching from a mock API designed to simulate future backend integration, and smooth animations. The app's entry point remains logic-free, assembling components declaratively to showcase best practices.

## ✨ Features

- 🌗 Dark / Light theme switcher with persistence
- 🔄 Async fake API data (loading states included)
- 🎥 Animated brand carousel with Framer Motion
- 📱 Fully responsive design

## 🔮 Possible Future Improvements

> - Integrate a real backend instead of the current mock API
> - Enhance the mobile responsiveness and layout for smaller devices
> - Add additional pages to extend the app beyond a single landing page
> - Implement more advanced, useful features on those new pages to make the project more interactive and engaging
> - Introduce full-stack functionality as I continue developing my backend skills
> - Add automated tests and improve accessibility compliance
